Function: Used to retrieve data from the server.

Safe and Idempotent: GET requests should not change the state of the server, and making the same GET request multiple times should have the same result.

POST:
Function: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.

Not Idempotent: POST requests can have side effects on the server, and making the same POST request multiple times may result in different outcomes (e.g., creating a new resource each time).

PUT:
Function: Used to update a resource or create it if it doesn't exist at a specified URI.
Idempotent: Repeating the same PUT request with the same data should have the same result as a single request.

PATCH:
Function: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
Idempotent: Repeating the same PATCH request with the same data should have the same result as a single request.

DELETE:
Function: Used to request the removal of a resource at a specified URI.
Idempotent: Repeating the same DELETE request should have the same result as a single request (i.e., deleting the resource if it exists).

OPTIONS:
Function: Used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
Safe and Idempotent: OPTIONS requests are typically safe and idempotent. They provide information about the supported HTTP methods, headers, and other options for a resource.

HEAD:
Function: Similar to GET but retrieves only the headers of the response, not the actual data.
Safe and Idempotent: HEAD requests should not change the state of the server and should be idempotent.

CONNECT:
Function: Used to establish a network connection to a resource, usually for secure communication through a proxy.
Not Idempotent: CONNECT requests are not idempotent because they establish a connection, which cannot be repeated in the same way.
TRACE:

Function: Used for diagnostic purposes to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the request-response cycle.
Safe and Idempotent: TRACE requests should not change the state of the server and should be idempotent.

PATCH:
Function: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
Idempotent: Repeating the same PATCH request with the same data should have the same result as a single request.
